This repository documents my journey toward becoming a GenAI Solution Architect, focusing on building production-ready systems using Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Agentic AI, and enterprise workflows across platforms such as Azure and Databricks.

🎯 Objectives
Implement RAG systems across complexity levels: 
   1) Naive RAG
   2) Advanced RAG  
   3) Agentic RAG
      
Build agent-based and multi-agent systems
Evaluate embedding and LLM model choices
Design enterprise-grade architectures
Deploy solutions across cloud platforms
Implement fallback and monitoring strategies

🗂️ Project Roadmap

Naive RAG — Baseline Enterprise Knowledge Assistant

Advanced RAG — Hybrid Retrieval & Reranking

Agentic RAG — Intelligent Retrieval Agents

Multi-Agent Systems — Autonomous Workflows

Enterprise Deployment — Azure & Databricks Implementations
